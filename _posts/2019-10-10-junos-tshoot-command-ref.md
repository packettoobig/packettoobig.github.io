Hey, because it is always handy to have a quick command reference, here are a few useful ones that I sometimes need to find quickly.
I will try to keep it up-to-date.

## Interfaces

Display the interface part of the configuration
`show configuration interfaces`

Quickly check L1 and L2 status (BPDUs, tx and rx errors)
`show interfaces <interface-name> media`

SFP/Transceiver/Fibre checking
`show interfaces diagnostics optics <interface-name>`

List all interfaces with their IP
`show interfaces terse`

Find out which interface is part of which VRF
`show interfaces routing-instance all terse`

## LACP

Show the status of all LACP interfaces:
`show lacp interfaces`
`show lacp statistics interfaces`

## ARP and NDP

Display the ARP table (ipv4)
`show arp`

Display the ND table (ipv6)
