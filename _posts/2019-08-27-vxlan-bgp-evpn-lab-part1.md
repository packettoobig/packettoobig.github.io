excerpt: First post of the VXLAN BGP EVPN Serie. I will probably do more, like adding VPC, and explaining how to go in and out of the fabric (like the internet) in a future post.

This week I heavily focused on the VXLAN BGP EVPN technology in EVE-NG.
Here is the topology I'm using :

If you want to learn more about BGP EVPN and VXLAN, I can recommend the [Network Direction Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtuXekfqj-paqsxtqVNCC2A), and particularly their VxLAN Playlist : 

Now that it is out of the way, let's focus on configuration.
We will be using NX-OS 9.2(2), on the Nexus 9000v platform, in my EVE-NG lab.

## Underlay configuration

The first thing we need is a working underlay network.

We will use basic OSPF for this (for configuration scalability, we also often use *unnumbered OSPF*, but this is out of the scope of this blog post).

Please Note that **I will not** publish every switch configuration, because I want my readers to think, and not just copy-paste text.ðŸ˜‰

    interface loopback0
      ip address 10.255.255.1/32
      ip router ospf 1 area 0.0.0.0
    

You probably noticed a few things :

1. We are using the OSPF "point-to-point" type. This is to avoid unnecessary DR/BDR election
2. The reference bandwidth has been set to 100Gbps, this is a typical datacenter scenario here.

We also typically put the loopback as an OSPF passive interface. I did not do it here, because it's a lab environment and the configuration file is already long enough.

## Underlay Verification

We need to check that everything works from the underlay before moving on.

First we need to check the OSPF adjacencies :

    SPINE1# show ip ospf neighbors
     OSPF Process ID 1 VRF default
     Total number of neighbors: 3
     Neighbor ID     Pri State            Up Time  Address         Interface
     10.255.0.1        1 FULL/ -          03:54:04 10.1.1.0        Eth1/11
     10.255.0.2        1 FULL/ -          03:54:01 10.1.2.0        Eth1/12
     10.255.0.3        1 FULL/ -          03:54:10 10.1.3.0        Eth1/13
    

Then, we are checking the proper communication between the spine and the leaves

    SPINE1# ping 10.255.0.1 source-interface loopback 0 count 2
    PING 10.255.0.1 (10.255.0.1): 56 data bytes
    64 bytes from 10.255.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=254 time=4.147 ms
    64 bytes from 10.255.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=254 time=2.997 ms
    
    SPINE1# ping 10.255.0.2 source-interface loopback 0 count 2
    PING 10.255.0.2 (10.255.0.2): 56 data bytes
    64 bytes from 10.255.0.2: icmp_seq=0 ttl=254 time=3.922 ms
    64 bytes from 10.255.0.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=254 time=2.356 ms
    
    SPINE1# ping 10.255.0.3 source-interface loopback 0 count 2
    PING 10.255.0.3 (10.255.0.3): 56 data bytes
    64 bytes from 10.255.0.3: icmp_seq=0 ttl=254 time=2.941 ms
    64 bytes from 10.255.0.3: icmp_seq=1 ttl=254 time=3.659 ms
    

We finish our testing with a traceroute, showing that we are indeed two hops away from SPINE2

    SPINE1# traceroute 10.255.255.2 source-interface loopback 0
    traceroute to 10.255.255.2 (10.255.255.2) from 10.255.255.1 (10.255.255.1), 30 hops max, 40 byte packets
     1  10.1.1.0 (10.1.1.0)  3.591 ms  3.323 ms  4.003 ms
     2  10.255.255.2 (10.255.255.2)  4.227 ms  4.18 ms  4.253 ms
    

Now, let's move to the good stuff, the Overlay !

## Overlay Configuration

This is where it gets interesting.

We need to enable the following features on all equipment :

    feature bgp
    feature interface-vlan
    feature vn-segment-vlan-based
    feature fabric forwarding
    feature nv overlay
    nv overlay evpn
    

We have to configure a full BGP EVPN reachability for all Nexus switches.

Here is the example of SPINE1. The configuraton is similar for all equipments, since only the router-id and neighbors change.

    router bgp 65000
      router-id 10.255.255.1
      neighbor 10.255.0.1
        remote-as 65000
        update-source loopback0
        address-family l2vpn evpn
          send-community
          send-community extended
      neighbor 10.255.0.2
        remote-as 65000
        update-source loopback0
        address-family l2vpn evpn
          send-community
          send-community extended
      neighbor 10.255.0.3
        remote-as 65000
        update-source loopback0
        address-family l2vpn evpn
          send-community
          send-community extended
      neighbor 10.255.255.2
        remote-as 65000
        update-source loopback0
        address-family l2vpn evpn
          send-community
          send-community extended
    

Please note that in a typical datacenter, the spines are route-reflectors. We are simplifying things a bit for better readability (but the configuration is longer because we need all the iBGP neighbors).

### Leaf-Specific Config

Since the spines are NOT used for hosts, there is no need for an anycast gateway, and therefore no need to configure anything related to the anycast gateway

The leaves will be the only switches that handles direct host connections, and will then assume the role of VTEP and gateway.

I need to configure the anycast gateway mac on my leaves : I'm using mac addresses *0000.1111.1111*, *0000.1111.2222* and *0000.1111.3333* . In a real world scenario, be careful not to assign a mac address that is already assigned to a host (or will in the future).

    fabric forwarding anycast-gateway-mac XXXX.XXXX.XXXX
    

We will also configure the VTEP via the NVE interface.

    interface nve1
      no shutdown
      host-reachability protocol bgp
      source-interface loopback0
    

### BGP verification

You will notice that your typical `show ip bgp summary` does not return any information about your neighbors. It is an expected behavior since you are peering on the "evpn" address family.

To check your neighbors, you need to type the `show bgp l2vpn evpn summary`

    SPINE1# show bgp l2vpn evpn summary
    *** truncated output***
    Neighbor        V    AS MsgRcvd MsgSent   TblVer  InQ OutQ Up/Down  State/PfxRcd
    10.255.0.1      4 65000     221     221        6    0    0 03:35:17 0
    10.255.0.2      4 65000     219     219        6    0    0 03:34:01 0
    10.255.0.3      4 65000     218     218        6    0    0 03:32:32 0
    10.255.255.2    4 65000     226     226        6    0    0 03:40:34 0
    

We see here the proper establishment of the neighboring relationship, but we are still not sending or receiving any prefix/mac. For this part to work, we need to work on the full configuration of the VNI, VRF, VLANs, and gateways.

## VNI, VRF, VTEP and Gateway Configuration

This is the hardest part to understand for anyone that has never deployed VXLAN with BGP EVPN.

The following features will be deployed :

1. L3VNI
2. VRF
3. RD and RT
4. VTEP
5. ARP Suppression
6. Head-end Replication
7. Anycast Gateway
8. EVPN

Please note that you **don't need to configure anything on the Spines anymore** at this point, since the VTEPs are the leaves !

#### L3VNI

Basically, in a datacenter environment, we will have "Tenants" or "Customers". We want every customer/tenant to be isolated in its own VRF.

In our simple example, we only have 1 customer, so we will create only one VRF.

For each VRF, we need a "L3VNI" for routing between each Subnet (in our case between 192.168.1.0/24 and 192.168.2.0/24).

The first step is to create a "routing vlan" or "L3VNI" (since each of our VXLAN will be associated with a VLAN).

To simplify the L3VNI part, we will use the same VLAN ID than the VXLAN VNI. Keep in mind that it is not mandatory at all (and that you can have 2^24 VNIs, as opposed to 2^12 VLANs).

So, we first create a VLAN that we associate with a VNI :

    vlan 10
      vn-segment 10
    

Then, we create our VRF and associate our VNI number with it:

    vrf context VRF10
      vni 10
      rd auto
      address-family ipv4 unicast
        route-target both auto
        route-target both auto evpn
    

After that, we create our L3VNI routing SVI :

    interface vlan 10
      vrf member VRF10
      no shutdown
      ip forward
    

Please note the "ip forward" command that allows it to do routing even without an ip address.

We then tell our VTEP to associate the VNI number 10 to our VRF.

    interface nve1
      member vni 10 associate-vrf
    

The L3VNI part is over, we can now create our Bridge Domains (aka L2VNI)

#### L2VNI

On LEAF1, we will create a locally-signifiant VLAN1111, with a fabric-wide VXLAN 111111. This is the VXLAN that we will use for our 192.168.1.0/24 network.

    vlan 1111
      vn-segment 111111
    

To use BGP, we need to inform the VTEP to do 2 things :

1. Suppress ARP traffic
2. Announce and receive mac addresses via BGP

    interface nve1
      member vni 111111
        suppress-arp
        ingress-replication protocol bgp
    

We then need to create our anycast-gateway (for inter-VXLAN routing basically)

    interface vlan 1111
      no shutdown
      vrf member VRF10
      ip address 192.168.1.254/24
      fabric forwarding mode anycast-gateway
    

And we finish the config by telling evpn (so bgp) to announce this VNI with automatically defined RD and RT (best-practice for a Cisco-Only fabric).

    evpn
      vni 111111 l2
        rd auto
        route-target import auto
        route-target export auto
    

And we finish by configuring the access ports (like we've been doing forever)

    interface Eth1/11-2
      switchport mode access
      switchport access vlan 1111
      no shutdown
    

We need to do the same thing on LEAF2 and LEAF3 at this point.

Do not forget that the VNI is a fabric-wide identifier, and that the VLAN is only local to the switch. It means that as soon as you configure the proper 111111 VNI, you can assign it to any VLAN. This is what allow you to scale a lot more with VXLAN.

Please note that on old version of NX-OS, we also needed to configure the following statement :

    router bgp 65000
      vrf VRF10
        address-family ipv4 unicast
          advertise l2vpn evpn
    

There is no need to do that anymore. If you do it on the newer Nexus platform, you will get the following message : `Command 'advertise l2vpn evpn' has been deprecated and no longer has any effect.` I'm just putting it here for reference for the folks that still use old versions of NX-OS.

We are done with the configuration ! We just need to check that everything works properly now.

## Final Verification and useful commands

### Verifications

The first thing we need to do is to check the communication between our hosts.

We can see there is no issue communicating with a host on the same switch (we are here using the traditionnal VLAN behavior, no VXLAN or BGP is needed).

    root@PC1:~# ping 192.168.1.2 -c 2
    PING 192.168.1.2 (192.168.1.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from 192.168.1.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=5.15 ms
    64 bytes from 192.168.1.2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=4.33 ms
    

We are also able to ping another host using the same VXLAN, on another switch.

    root@PC1:~# ping 192.168.1.4 -c 2
    PING 192.168.1.4 (192.168.1.4) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from 192.168.1.4: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=11.0 ms
    64 bytes from 192.168.1.4: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=11.0 ms
    

Here is the interesting stuff : we are able to ping a host that is on another switch, and on another VXLAN, using our anycast gateway and L3VNI !

    root@PC1:~# ping 192.168.2.8 -c 2
    PING 192.168.2.8 (192.168.2.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from 192.168.2.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=62 time=15.4 ms
    64 bytes from 192.168.2.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=62 time=15.4 ms

There is also the `show bgp l2vpn evpn` command, but the output is so large that I can't fit it in here. It is basically the "show me everything" command

EDIT : I can recommend you this amazing cisco live presentation document : [https://www.ciscolive.com/c/dam/r/ciscolive/us/docs/2018/pdf/BRKDCN-3040.pdf](https://www.ciscolive.com/c/dam/r/ciscolive/us/docs/2018/pdf/BRKDCN-3040.pdf) It goes through a lot of troubleshooting steps for BGP EVPN VXLAN.
